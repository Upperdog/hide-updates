# Hide Updates

This plugin hides update notices for core, plugin, and theme updates in WordPress admin for all users **except super admins**. It's useful for agencies or developers who take care of updates and maintenance of a client's site and wants to hide the notices for other users. Super admins are not affected by this plugin and will continue to see all the updates.

The plugin also hides the Updates link in the WordPress admin menu. If a user for some reason ends up on the updates page anyway, the plugin will also redirect the user back to the dashboard.
